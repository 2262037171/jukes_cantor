# Description
The file `Public_Eacles_Morpho_Aglia.fas` has 233 aligned DNA sequences from closely related species in the standardized FASTA format. Using the Jukes Cantor distance method, this program computes the distance (i.e. dissimilarity) between these sequences, discards distances greater than 4% and generates a sparse "distance matrix" that contains 3 pieces of information: 1) sequence index #1, 2) sequence index #2, and 3) the jukes cantor distance value.
